# 83 Spaulding Street Property Site

This repository contains a static marketing site for the 83 Spaulding Street student rental. Everything is pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it can be hosted directly with GitHub Pages or any other static host.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
2. Update the contact information on `contact.html` to match your email address and phone number. The form opens a draft email in the visitor's email client.
3. Commit and push the repository to GitHub.
4. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings â†’ Pages) and point it to the `main` branch root. The site will be available under `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/` once GitHub finishes the build.

## Customizing

- **Images:** Replace the hero background image URL in `static/css/style.css` with your own hosted photo.
- **Branding:** Adjust colors by editing the CSS variables at the top of `static/css/style.css`.
- **Content:** Update copy directly inside `index.html`, `features.html`, and `contact.html`.

No server-side components remain, so there is nothing to deploy beyond the static files.
